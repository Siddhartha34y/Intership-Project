            <h3>Eiffel Tower</h3>
            <p>The Eiffel Tower, located in Paris, France, is an iconic symbol of French culture and engineering excellence. Designed by Gustave Eiffel and his team, it was constructed between 1887 and 1889 for the Exposition Universelle (World's Fair) to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. Standing at 330 meters (1,083 feet) tall, it was the world's tallest man-made structure until 1930. Initially met with criticism for its unconventional design, the wrought-iron lattice tower is now celebrated as a masterpiece of modern architecture and a global cultural landmark. The Eiffel Tower attracts millions of visitors annually, offering breathtaking views of Paris from its three levels, accessible via elevators or stairs. Illuminated by 20,000 light bulbs at night, it is a beacon of romance and artistry. Beyond its role as a tourist destination, it serves as a hub for radio and television transmissions, making it both a cultural and functional marvel.</p>

            <h3>Statue of Liberty</h3>
            <p>The Statue of Liberty, located on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, is one of the most recognizable symbols of freedom and democracy in the world. Officially named "Liberty Enlightening the World," the statue was a gift from France to the United States in 1886 to commemorate their enduring friendship and celebrate the centennial of American independence. Designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and constructed with an internal iron framework by Gustave Eiffel, the statue stands at 305 feet (93 meters) from the base to the tip of the torch. It depicts a robed female figure representing Libertas, the Roman goddess of liberty, holding a torch above her head in her right hand and a tablet in her left hand inscribed with the date of American Independence, July 4, 1776. The Statue of Liberty is not only a welcoming symbol to immigrants arriving by sea but also a global emblem of liberty and human rights. Designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it attracts millions of visitors annually who come to admire its historical significance, architectural beauty, and panoramic views of New York City from its pedestal and crown.</p>

            <h3>Gateway of India</h3>
            <p>The Gateway of India is a historic monument located in Mumbai, India, and stands as a magnificent example of Indo-Saracenic architecture, blending Hindu, Muslim, and Western design elements. Built in 1924, it was constructed to commemorate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to India in 1911. The archway, made of yellow basalt stone, stands 26 meters (85 feet) tall and is one of the most iconic landmarks in Mumbai. The Gateway of India symbolizes India’s historical connection to British rule, as it was also the site where the last British troops left India in 1948, marking the end of British colonial rule. Today, it remains a popular tourist destination, offering scenic views of the Arabian Sea and being a hub for boat tours to nearby Elephanta Island and other attractions. The monument is open year-round and serves as both a historical site and a gathering place for locals and visitors alike.</p>
